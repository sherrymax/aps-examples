#### The project contains all the components required to trigger a boundary message event using REST calls

### Use-Case / Requirement
A serial approval pipeline process with two-levels. The tasks approved by first-level approver should route to task-list of second-level approver (Manager). The first-level approver should also have the capability to revert/recall the submitted tasks. Thus recalled tasks should be closed/moved out from second-level approver's (Manager) task-list and requeued back to first-level approver's inbox, without any loss of data.


### Prerequisites to run this demo end-2-end

* Alfresco Process Services (powered by Activiti) (Version 1.9 and above) - If you don't have it already, you can download a 30 day trial from [Alfresco Process Services (APS)](https://www.alfresco.com/products/business-process-management/alfresco-activiti).Instructions & help available at [Activiti Docs](http://docs.alfresco.com/activiti/docs/), [Alfresco BPM Community](https://community.alfresco.com/community/bpm)


## Configuration Steps

### Activiti Setup and Process Deployment
1. Setup Alfresco Activiti if you don't have one already. Instructions & help available at [Activiti Docs](http://docs.alfresco.com/activiti/docs/), [Alfresco BPM Community](https://community.alfresco.com/community/bpm)
2. Import the [Save-Face-SME.zip](Save-Face-SME.zip) app available in this project into Activiti.
3. The process flow.  ![Process-Flow](Process-Flow.png)
4. The process configuration. ![Process-Configuration](Process-Configuration.png)
5. The boundary signal event. ![Signal-Boundary-Event](Signal-Boundary-Event.png)
6. The signal event definition. ![Signal-Definition](Signal-Definition.png)
7. Publish/Deploy the App.

### POSTMAN
1. Use POSTMAN to make REST calls and trigger the Boundary Signal Events.

    TIP: Quickly import REST Calls from [POSTMAN Collection](Postman-Collection-SignalEvents.postman_collection.json).

2. As the first step, REST GET call should be to get the Execution ID of the targeted Boundary Signal Event.
```
http://<hostname>:<port>/activiti-app/api/runtime/executions?tenantId=<tenantId>&processInstanceId=<instanceID>
```
The configuration is shown below. ![REST-SME-ExeId](REST-SME-ExeId.png)
If necessary, the value of Execution ID can be cross-verified by querying the DB.

3. As the second step, REST PUT call should send trigger for Boundary Signal Event.
```
http://<hostname>:<port>/activiti-app/api/runtime/executions/<execution-id-of-boundary-signal-event>?tenantId=<tenantId>
```
The header of PUT call is as follows:
```javascript
Authorization = Basic xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
cache-control = no-cache
content-type = application/json
```
The body of the PUT call is as follows: 
```json
{
"action":"signalEventReceived",
"signalName":"saveFaceSignal"
}
```
The configuration is shown below. ![REST-Trigger-SME](REST-Trigger-SME.png)

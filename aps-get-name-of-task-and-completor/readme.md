#### The project contains the tips required to get a task name and name of user who completed that task

### Use-Case / Requirement
Upon a task completion, it is required to capture the details of the task. Mainly:
1. Task Name
2. Name of user who completes the task
These details can be useful for routing the workflow or to be maintained as part of the process data.

Here is a tip to quickly capture these details as part of ScriptTaskListener

#### Example of integration between Java Spring Boot Application and APS

### Use-Case / Requirement
A Java Spring Boot application should be integrated with APS and should have the following capabilities.
1. Invoke a process instance in APS.
2. The invoked process instance should return values to the Spring Boot Application at any point of its life span.

### Design
Foolowing is the design to accomplish the requirements. 
1. The APS Process Instance is invoked from Spring Boot App by using the APS-REST API Calls. 
2. A REST API service is built using the Spring Boot App. This REST service is invoked from APS and values are passed.
